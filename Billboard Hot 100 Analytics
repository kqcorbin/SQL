# For this project, I downloaded Billboard Hot 100 data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Billboard data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE 'Billboard Hot 100'.'charts (
date varchar(255),
spot int,
song varchar(255),
artist varchar(255),
last_week int,
peak_rank int,
weeks_on_board int
)

#Then I inserted the charts.csv into the table.

#Next, I cleaned and altered some of the data using the following SQL queries:

#Add a new column 'id' datatype int as a Primary Key with Auto-Increment as the 1st column
Alter TABLE charts ADD id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT FIRST;

#Modify 'date' column's datatype to DATE TIME
ALTER TABLE charts
MODIFY COLUMN date DATETIME;

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL queries:

#What were the songs in the Billboard Hot 100 the week I was born (born on June 25, 1997)
SELECT *
FROM charts
WHERE date < '1997-06-25' AND date > '1997-06-18'
ORDER BY spot

#What are the 5 songs with the most weeks on the billboard, in order by number of weeks
SELECT song,
	   artist,
	   MAX(weeks_on_board)
FROM charts
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 5

#Which artists have had the most billboard hits since 2000 without any features
WITH solo AS
(SELECT *,
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) AS year
 FROM charts
 WHERE artist NOT LIKE '%feat%' AND artist NOT LIKE '%&%'
 )
 
SELECT artist,
	   COUNT(DISTINCT song)
FROM solo
WHERE year >= '2000'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC

#List of songs that have had a last week position that is lower than the songs current week position
SELECT DISTINCT song
FROM charts
WHERE last_week < spot

#What artist have never peaked into the top 10 of the billbord charts without a feature or feauring

#How many weeks has Drake had at least one song on the billboard charts either as lead artist or featuring artist
