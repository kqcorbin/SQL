# For this project, I downloaded Pizza Place Sales data from Maven Analytics as a part of the Maven Pizza Challenge.
# This project will use SQL to analyze a years worth of sales data from a fictitious Pizza Place.
# Then I created tables to insert Pizza Place data into.
# There are 4 tables being added: orders, order_details, pizza, pizza_types
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using mySQL

# Create the orders table
CREATE TABLE 'Pizza Pizza'.'orders' (
'order_id' int,
'date' text,
'time' text
)

# Imported the orders.csv file into the table

# Create the order_details table
CREATE TABLE 'Pizza Pizza'.'order_details' (
'order_details_id' int,
'order_id' int,
'pizza_id' text,
'quanity' int
)

# Imported the order_details.csv file into the table

# Create the pizzas tables
CREATE TABLE 'Pizza Pizza'.'pizzas' (
'pizza_id' text,
'pizza_type_id' text,
'size' text,
'price' double
)

# Imported the pizzas.csv file into the table

# Create the pizza_types tables
CREATE TABLE 'Pizza Pizza'.'pizza_types' (
'pizza_type_id' text,
'name' text,
'category' text,
'ingredients' text
)

# Imported the pizza_types.csv file into the table

# Next, I cleaned and altered some of the data using the following SQL queries to change columns datatypes:

# Change column 'date' to the DATE datatype
ALTER TABLE `Pizza Pizza`.`orders` 
CHANGE COLUMN `date` `date` DATE NULL DEFAULT NULL ;

# Change column 'time' to the TIME datatype
ALTER TABLE 'Pizza Pizza'.'orders'
CHANGE COLUMN 'time' 'time' TIME NULL DEFAULT NULL ;

# Next, I answered a few questions using SQL queries 

# What days and times seem to be the busiest (most orders)
