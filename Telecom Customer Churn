# In this Project, I will be analyzing data on a Telecom company's customer churn  
# The data is split into 2 different tables - customer_churn and zips_population  
# These tables contain data for customer data and zip codes with their populations, respectively
# These tables were Created in MySQL and then the .csv files were imported into their respective tables

# Exploratory Analysis
# Using SQL, I was able to explore and answer questions about the data to help the company understand their customers

# How many total customers were there and how many did not stay (churned)?
# ANSWER: Total - 7043 ; Churned - 1869

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Customer_ID)  AS total_customers,
		   (SELECT COUNT(*)
		    FROM customer_churn
        WHERE customer_status LIKE 'Churned') AS Churned
FROM Telecom.customer_churn;

# Of those customers that churned, how many were men vs women?
# ANSWER: MEN - 930 ; Female - 939

SELECT  GENDER,
		COUNT(1) AS number_of_churned
FROM customer_churn
WHERE customer_status LIKE 'churned'
GROUP BY 1

# What were the 3 most frequent churn categories causing customer churn?
# ANSWER: 1) Competitor - 841 2) Dissatifaction - 321 3) Attitude - 314 

SELECT  churn_category,
        COUNT(*) AS num_customers
FROM customer_churn
WHERE customer_status LIKE 'churned'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 3
