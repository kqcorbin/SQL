# In this Project, I will be analyzing data on a Telecom company's customer churn  
# The data is split into 2 different tables - customer_churn and zips_population  
# These tables contain data for customer data and zip codes with their populations, respectively
# These tables were Created in MySQL and then the .csv files were imported into their respective tables

# Exploratory Analysis
# Using SQL, I was able to explore and answer questions about the data to help the company understand their customers
